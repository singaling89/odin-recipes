            <h2>Description</h2>

                <p>Thanksgiving leftovers are the gift that keeps on giving. We’ve created countless creative recipes to use up the rest of your leftover Thanksgiving turkey, but this classic casserole is one of our favourites. Simple to make and versatile to what you have on hand, this baked pasta dinner is not only the perfect post-holiday meal, but is a great staple week night dinner to make all year long. Here’s everything you need to know:</p>

                <p><b>What is turkey tetrazzini?</b><br />
                Turkey tetrazzini is an extra-comforting, baked spaghetti casserole filled with turkey, mushrooms, and cheese. Like most casseroles, this tetrazzini is totally versatile: add in your favorite veggies or switch out the protein (chicken tetrazzini is one of our go-to choices). Although you can switch out the protein, we love making this casserole post-Thanksgiving to use up all of our leftover turkey. Use your leftover classic roast turkey, or switch up the flavor profile with air fryer tandoori turkey, apple cider brined turkey, or harissa spiced turkey breast.</p>

                <p><b>The difference between tetrazzini and spaghetti:</b><br />
                To start off: spaghetti refers to a type of pasta, while tetrazzini refers to a specific baked dish that often uses spaghetti. That being said, if you’re curious as to what the difference between dishes like chicken tetrazzini and chicken spaghetti is, think of baked spaghetti as the slightly creamier, slightly cheesier version of tetrazzini. In the end, they’re very similar recipes.</p>
