        <h2>Description</h2>
        
            <p>Beautifully flaky and tender when cooked, mahi mahi is the seafood dinner you should be making all year long. The firm and mild fish is not only completely delicious, but super-versatile—you can bake, sear, grill, or fry it and top it with any number of different sauces or dressings. Our favourite way to prep it? Cook it on the stove with some fresh veg like asparagus, then smother it in a lemony butter sauce. Here's how to make it the best it can be:</p>

            <p><b>How to Cook Mahi Mahi</b><br />
            It truly couldn’t be simpler: Just add the fish to the pan, cook it for a few minutes per side, then make a super-simple garlicky lemon-butter sauce in the same pan. We like to cook up a little asparagus too to serve on the side, but feel free to skip it or swap in whatever seasonal veg you like.</p>

            <p>If your fish starts to stick to the pan, don’t panic. Fish can occasionally stick when you’re cooking it, but there are a few sure fire tricks to make sure that doesn’t happen. First, pat your fish dry on both sides before you put it in the pan. Second, make sure the pan is really hot before you add the fish. You don’t want it to be smoking, but it should definitely sizzle when the fish hits the pan. Finally, let the fish cook for at least 3 minutes before you try to flip it. It will release from the pan when it’s ready, so if it’s sticking, give it another minute and then try again.</p>
