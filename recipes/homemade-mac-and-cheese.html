            <h2>Description</h2>

            <p>A comfort food classic, mac and cheese can mean something different to everyone. For some, it’s the decadent holiday side their plate just isn’t complete without. For others, it’s the reliable box they grab when the 1 a.m. cravings start to hit. Here at Delish, our best-ever mac and cheese is perfect for any occasion, from family weeknight dinners to holiday spreads. In our book, the perfect macaroni and cheese recipe has to nail three things: be extra creamy, plenty cheesy, and paired with a golden, crunchy topping. This tried-and-true recipe aces all of these requirements (and more!) with flying colors, so put that box back on the shelf, and keep reading for all of our top tips on making this creamy, cheesy mac.</p>

            <p><b>The best cheese for mac and cheese:</b> <br />
            Why choose just one when you can have three? Seriously, in our book, the best cheese to use for mac and cheese is a mix of a few. We went for a combo of cheddar, Gruyère, and Parmesan in this recipe. In our book, this is the perfect combination to create our cheesy, rich sauce, but feel free to experiment! Monterey Jack, fontina, or Colby Jack would all be delicious here.</p>
            
            <p>The most important thing to remember? Always shred your cheese fresh from the block — <em>this</em> is the difference between good and great homemade mac and cheese. The pre-shredded bags just won’t melt as well, so if you’re looking for the ultimate creamy, cheesy mac, then freshly shredding your cheese is always the way to go.</p>

            <p><b>How to make the best mac and cheese:</b><br />
            Along with choosing the best cheeses possible, there are a few other key steps to creating this perfect mac and cheese. Adding mustard powder gives that tangy bite to balance out the cheesy, creamy richness—don’t skip it! We’re also baking our mac and cheese in this recipe with a Parm and panko topping until golden and bubbly. While you don’t technically have to bake your mac and cheese, the crunchy, buttery topping and bubbling result is truly worth the extra step for the best mac possible.</p>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>

                <ul>
                    <li><b>1/2 cup</b> butter, plus more for baking dish</li>
                    <li><b>1 lb.</b> elbow macaroni</li>
                    <li><b>1/2 cup</b> all-purpose flour</li>
                    <li><b>5 cups</b> whole milk</li>
                    <li><b>1 tsp.</b> mustard powder</li>
                    <li><b>12 oz.</b> shredded cheddar</li>
                    <li><b>8 oz.</b> shredded gruyère</li>
                    <li><b>3 oz.</b> finely grated parmesan</li>
                    <li><b>1 cup</b> panko bread crumbs</li>
                    <li><b>3 tbsp.</b> extra-virgin olive oil</li>
                    <li>Freshly ground black pepper and sea salt, to taste</li>
                </ul>

        <h2>Directions</h2>

                <ol>
                    <li>Preheat oven to 375°. Grease a 13"x9" baking dish with butter. In a large pot of boiling salted water, cook macaroni, stirring occasionally, until al dente, 5 to 6 minutes. Drain.</li>

                    <li>In a large saucepan over medium heat, melt 1 stick butter. Sprinkle flour over and cook, stirring, until slightly golden, 2 to 3 minutes. Pour in milk and whisk until combined. Add mustard powder; season with salt and pepper. Bring to a simmer over medium-high heat and cook, stirring, until sauce starts to thicken, about 2 minutes.</li>

                    <li>Remove pan from heat and whisk in cheddar, Gruyère, and 1 cup Parmesan until melted and smooth. Stir in macaroni and transfer to prepared dish.</li>

                    <li>In a small bowl, combine panko, oil, and remaining 1/2 cup Parmesan. Sprinkle over macaroni; season with more pepper.</li>

                    <li>Bake mac and cheese until bubbly and golden, 25 to 30 minutes. Let cool 10 minutes.</li>

                    <li>Serve!</li>
